ok I decided to give Redux another try, now that I am doing more advance projects I have more state that needs to be managed and I understand why redux is better than passing props down from component to component. I have looked into reducer before so I was familiar with ACTION, REDUCER, STORE. You also have the middleware between the action and reducer. I'm looking forward to advancing my redux with my coding to get a better understanding of it.

So the actionTypes are just that the name of the ACTION.

The REDUCER is the function that the action needs.

Then the store is basically storing data for the app.

The Provider connects the store with the app.

dispatchers are used to change the state.
 
selectors are used to access the state.
